# Weols User Management Addon
WUMA is an addon for server administrators and allows you to restrict and limit anything from usergroups and individual players. It integrates with any administrator addons that implements CAMI.

You can check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Weol/WUMA/wiki) for a in-depth explanation of the interface.

## Restrictions
You can restrict entities, weapons, vehicles, npcs, tools, effects, ragdolls, properties, and props. Make individual players exempt from their usergroup's restrictions. Inherit restrictions from other usergroups.

## Limits
You can limit entities, weapons, vehicles, npcs, tools, effects, ragdolls, properties, and props. They can even be infinite limits. You can make different items share the same limit. This is very useful if you for example want players to only be able to spawn one vehicle at a time, but your server has many different vehicles. You can make all your vehicles share the same limit.

## Getting started
You need to be superadmin in order to use WUMA. Use the command wuma_menu in order to open the WUMA interface. If you are using ULX then you will find the WUMA interface as a tab in the ULX interface.

If you encounter any problems with the addon please report them to me so I can fix them. If you do please post any error messages and a list of all the addons you are using. Creating an issue is the most efficient way to get my attention.
